During the web developer track, I designed an HTML code that included five buttons for directional control. These buttons were intended to represent different directions (e.g., up, down, left, right, and stop). To add functionality to these buttons, I integrated the HTML code with a backend system using PHP and MySQL. I connected the HTML interface to PHP MyAdmin, allowing for the storage and management of directional commands in a database. This setup enabled a seamless interaction between the user interface and the backend database, demonstrating a practical application of web development skills.
